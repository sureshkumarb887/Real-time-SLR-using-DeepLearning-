GESTUREBRIDGE : REAL-TIME SIGN LANGUAG RECOGNITION USING DEEP LEARNING MODEL

ABSTRACT

Introduction of a novel approach utilizing deep learning models and computer vision for sign language recognition (SLR). A review of machine and deep learning methods from 2014 to 2021 highlights the importance of conceptual classification for accurate interpretation. This work proposes a general framework emphasizing diverse input modalities for researchers in SLR. Advancements enable near real-time translation of continuous sign language communication, extending beyond character and word recognition. While acknowledging the effectiveness of existing models in various tasks, we note their limitations in generalizing for commercial deployment. The implementation of a deep learning model is a promising step forward, offering improved recognition capabilities in SLR.
